* I wanted to see if I could implement the final game() function with the playRound() function still
  returning a string. Turns out you can, but the result is just lots of case statements.
* I couldn't resist using a for loop to run the 5 rounds, even though I'm not supposed to know them yet. I just couldn't bring myself to copy and
  paste that much code. Admittedly, it wouldn't be that much code if I didn't force myself to use
  the case statement to parse the string output from the playRound() function.
* I don't see much advantage at this point in doing a new version with more sensible return values
  and functions. I may do this when we revisit this code after we are supposed to know loops.
